# Unicornafl Rust Bindings

This directory contained the Rust bindings that we developed as part of BaseSAFE.
They have since been merged completely into [unicornafl](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/unicornafl).
Also, pure Unicorn bindings without AFL++ support were merged to upstream [Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/tree/next).

The bindings are based on SÃ©bastien Duquette's (@ekse) [unicorn-rs](https://github.com/unicorn-rs/unicorn-rs) bindings for Unicorn.
For access to the original BaseSAFE, look at [the previous version in github](https://github.com/fgsect/BaseSAFE/tree/06b2822225faef91098810c1aa1fca2277526ad7/unicornafl_bindings).
