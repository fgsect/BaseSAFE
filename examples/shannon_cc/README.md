# ERRC

This directory contains a harness emulating the main event handler for LTE Radio Resource Control messages, primarily the ASN.1 decoders used within.

The ```.raw``` files inside the _data/_ contain validly encoded ASN.1 packets with a 1 byte preamble, which is used within the harness for guidance and data placement. 
Stripping this first byte, the packets can be decoded with publicly available tools (e.g. https://www.marben-products.com/decoder-asn1-lte/).

```Noise.py``` was used to generate the random packets building the baseline 
for our coverage guided parser deduction, as explained in the paper.

In _connections/_, we collected input files generated by AFL++ during fuzzing.
The packets contain (partially) valid ASN.1 messages, again preceded by a 1 byte preamble, offering diverse characteristics.
These could, for example, be used as a corpus to fuzz other ASN.1 parsers.
